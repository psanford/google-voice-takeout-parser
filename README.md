# Google Voice Takeout Parser

This is a simple tool for parsing Google Voice takeout html files to either newline delimited json or sqlite.

```
google-voice-takeout-parser [-format=<json|sqlite>]

By default, the tool outputs in JSON format. Use the `-format` flag to specify SQLite output.

## Input

The tool expects HTML files from a Google Voice takeout in the current directory. It will process all `.html` files found.

## Output

### JSON Format

When using JSON output, each conversation is printed as a JSON object to stdout.

### SQLite Format

When using SQLite output, the tool creates a `conversations.db` file with the following schema:

- `conversations`: Stores overall conversation data
- `participants`: Stores participant information for each conversation
- `messages`: Stores individual messages within conversations
- `images`: Stores information about image attachments in messages
